# Prototype Submission for Africa's Talking Women in Technology Kampala Challenge

Thank you for reviewing my prototype! Please follow the instructions below to ensure the best experience:

## Instructions

1. **Load Time:** When using the link to the prototype, please wait for approximately 30 seconds to allow all animations to load completely.
2. **Animations:** If some animations do not appear, you can check the attached video below to see how the prototype is intended to function.
3. **Best Viewing Experience:** Some animations work better or are only visible when using a PC or desktop due to the hover and mouse enter settings.
